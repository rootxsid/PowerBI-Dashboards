## Summary of case study
This case study is to apply skills developed through the Power BI course offered by Data Camp using a real-world problem. This is the second project assignment.

## The Problem
In this case study, a fictitious client, Atlas Labs, have the primary goal of monitoring Key HR metrics on employees and understanding what factors impact attrition (Employee attrition is the naturally occurring, voluntary departure of employees from a company)

## Project Approach
As we build their report, it is key to understand the process we will follow in our report development in PowerBI. The process is summarized below:

**Step 1: Building the data model and analyzing the data**

- Requirements gathering
- Data Connections
- Data Transformation
- Building the data model
- Writing DAX measures

**Step 2: Report Design**

- Branding
- Defining the report layout
- Building your report with chart visualizations

## The Dataset: Requirements gathering, Data Connections and Data Transformation

For this case study, we will use the Kimball modelling approach as we model our data.

The Fact table stores the information about employee yearly reviews. We will also be working with multiple dimension tables to provide more context to the data we are working with. The final data model will follow a snowflake schema below.

The first step we will take is to open an empty PowerBI file and load and prepare our [dataset](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/6064/datasets/e2f7bf7250e8c73f79deffeed749aa1d08cd2591/Case%20Study_%20HR%20Analytics%20in%20Power%20BI%20-%20Exercises%20and%20Datasets.pdf) . We will import all the CSV files and load them into PowerBI. Ensure that the data is clean. Ensure you add either Fact OR Dim at the beginning of each table name, depending on the type of table it is.

## Building the data model: Date dimension and relating tables

In any Power BI report, it is recommended to have a dedicated date table for accurate date and time reporting. In this stage, we will also model our data. This will enable us to connect our six different tables.

The first step we will take is to create a dedicated date table. [Here is the DAX code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PpxSleyYT3BILZ3vVaa_BMYaEFvLgyT7kdT0ghr-704/edit?usp=sharing) we will use for the calculated Date Table. Next we will connect the following tables:

- Connect the DimDate table to FactPerfomanceRating and the DimEmployee table. Note that the last relationship will be inactive because we cannot have more than one active relationship between the same tables at once, in PowerBI.

- Connect the DimEducationLevel table to the DimEmployee table

- Connect FactPerfomanceRating table columns (EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobSatisfaction, RelationshipSatisfaction and WorkLifeBalance) to DimSatisfactionLevel table and use EnvironmentSatisfaction as the active connection.

- Connect FactPerfomanceRating table columns (SelfRating, ManagerRating) to DimRatingLevel and use the SelfRating column as the active connection.

## Exploring the data

We will explore our data and produce high level metrics to understand the attrition at the company. Rename page 1 of your PowerBI file to “Overview” and create a new table called _Measures to store all the measures that we will create. We will then display these measures using the card visual in our overview page. Let’s create the measures below:

__A measure to take count of all the employees__

```
TotalEmployees = DISTINCTCOUNT(DimEmployee[EmployeeID])
```

__Measures that take count of all employees that are currently active or inactive__

```
ActiveEmployee = CALCULATE([TotalEmployees], DimEmployee[Attrition] = "No")
```

```
InactiveEmployee = CALCULATE([TotalEmployees], DimEmployee[Attrition] = "Yes")
```

__Attrition Rate based on the measures we have created above.__

```
% Attrition Rate = [InactiveEmployee]/[TotalEmployees]
```

![Card Visual Employees](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121925698/222109562-dd2f1a2a-01c1-4764-a8f6-9458e4716630.jpg)


## Hiring trends over time

Next, we will analyze Atlas Labs' hiring trends over time to see where they have had the biggest growth in employees.

We will create a new measure called TotalEmployeesDate that uses the CALCULATE() function on our TotalEmployees Measure and the USERELATIONSHIP function in the filter. You may read more about USERELATIONSHIP function [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/userelationship-function-dax)

```
TotalEmployeesDate = 
CALCULATE (
    [TotalEmployees],
    USERELATIONSHIP ( DimEmployee[HireDate], DimDate[Date] )
)
```

Go ahead and create a stacked column chart. Add attrition to the legend on the chart to see the split of employees by active vs inactive. Change the X-axis from continuous to Categorical and Rename the chart to “Employee Hiring Trends”

![Employee Hiring Trends](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121925698/222109916-3978ea54-acf7-48e0-abbf-8ffcc709cb34.jpg)


## Analyzing departments and Job Roles

The next step, we will look into the typical roles department managers are hiring into the organization. This will enable every department to plan for new hiring requests in the future.

Create a clustered bar chart to show ActiveEmployees by Department. Rename this chart to “Active Employees by Department”. Add a treemap visualization to show Active employees by department and job role. Rename this chart to “Active Employees by Department and job role.”

![Active Employee by department and job role](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121925698/222110052-5da8134a-ebea-4e88-ad7b-cfd14c380c20.jpg)


## Keys Insights so far

- Atlas Labs has employed over 1,470 people
- Atlas Labs currently employs over 1,200 people
- The largest department so far is Technology
- The attrition rate for employees leaving the organization is 16%

Is Atlas labs competitive enough as an employer?

## Demographics: age and gender

The next step is to develop a good understanding of the diversity and inclusion metrics. We will focus on employee age and gender. Let’s create a new page in the report called “Demographics”

Below we can see the minimum and maximum value for age displayed by card visuals.

![Age visual](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121925698/222110121-dd9cc96c-f0ce-4f58-89b1-9361ddde1a94.jpg)


We want to take a closer look at the age distribution of employees so we will create a conditional column called AgeBins that separates employees' ages by bins in the following structure: <\20, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50>.

```
=Table.AddColumn(#"Changed Type", "AgeBins", each if [Age] >= 50 then "50>" else if [Age] >= 40 then "40-49" else if [Age] >= 30 then "30-39" else if [Age] >= 20 then "20-29" else "<20")
```

Next, we will visualize our results. We will create a visualization that shows Employees by age and another visualization that shows Total employees value distribution across Age Bins and Gender.

![Employees by Age](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121925698/222110213-f8996701-c7a9-4cef-8417-8889640e0980.jpg)


It would be beneficial to add a page level filter that enables you to look at the report page based on whether an employee is currently active or not.

## Marital Status and ethnicity

Next, we will be looking at further employee information regarding marital status and ethnicity. We will first visualize the count of all employees by marital status

![Employees by Marital Status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121925698/222110277-ecff9513-7075-4887-9f5b-cda07c5d2ca2.jpg)


Next, we will create a measure, AverageSalary inside the measure table. This works out the average salary of all employees.


```
AverageSalary = AVERAGE(DimEmployee[Salary])
```
Below is a visualization of employees by their average salary and ethnicity. 

![Employee by salary and race](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121925698/222112285-d73f9024-d02e-4f90-88e6-0c649932a108.jpg)


## Performance Tracker 1:

The HR Team would like to track the performance of the employees based on yearly performance reviews. We will create a new page in the report called “Performance Tracker”.

We will add a slicer with employee full name which has single select and search enabled. We will go on to add a card which shows selected employee start date, last review date and next review date

![Employee dates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121925698/222112185-eab306a7-f3a3-480f-9909-0ce5d0476bc5.jpg)



## Performance Tracker 2

Next we would like to take a closer look at individual review ratings. We will create satisfaction metrics inside the _Measures_ table and visualise them.


```
EnvironmentSatisfaction = CALCULATE(
MAX(FACTPerformanceRating[EnvironmentSatisfaction]),
USERELATIONSHIP(FACTPerformanceRating[EnvironmentSatisfaction], DimSatisfiedLevel[SatisfactionID]))
```

```
JobSatisfaction = MAX(FactPerformanceRating[JobSatisfaction])
```

```
RelationshipSatisfaction = CALCULATE(
MAX(FACTPerformanceRating
[RelationshipSatisfaction]),
USERELATIONSHIP(FACTPerformanceRating
[RelationshipSatisfaction], DimSatisfiedLevel[SatisfactionID])
)
```

![Ratings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121925698/222110497-91ad8055-87cc-4615-8116-ff92fd1ce65e.jpg)


## More Insights uncovered

- Majority of employees are between 20-29 yrs
- Atlas Labs employs 2.7% more women than men
- Employees who identify as
- Non Binary makeup 8.5% of total employees
- White have the highest average salary
- Mixed or multiple ethnic groups have one of the lowest average salaries

From the charts we’ve built, we can also see that the employees that have been considered frequent travelers have the highest attrition rate despite only making up 19% of the total hires.

## Creating a cohesive report

The final step is preparing to deliver our report to the key stakeholders at Atlas Labs. We will focus on delivering insights on attrition and what factors affect employee retention.

Here is the Overview Dashboard.
